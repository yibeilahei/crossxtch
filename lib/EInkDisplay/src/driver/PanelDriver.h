// FreeInk SDK — panel driver interface.
//
// One PanelDriver implementation exists per display controller (SSD1677,
// UC8253-X3, ED2208-M5, UC8253-Murphy). The FreeInkDisplay facade owns the
// framebuffer and selects a driver at begin(); the driver owns all
// controller-specific register sequences, LUTs, timing, and cross-call state.
//
// The facade does all framebuffer composition (clear/draw) itself and passes
// raw buffer pointers in here — drivers only touch hardware. `prev` is the
// previous frame in dual-buffer mode, or nullptr in single-buffer mode (the
// controller's own RAM holds the previous frame).

  // for single-buffer fast-diff: the first prev==nullptr refresh reuses whatever
  // RED holds. Callers seed the on-screen frame here just before releasing so that
